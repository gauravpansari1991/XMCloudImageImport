# For development purposes, note Next.js supports a .env.local
# file, which is already configured to be git ignored.
# Read more about Next.js support of environment variables here:

# The public URL to use for absolute URLs, which are required when
# the Next.js app is run within Sitecore editors.
# This should match the `serverSideRenderingEngineApplicationUrl`
# in your Sitecore configuration (see \sitecore\config\digitalsigns.config).
# Be sure to update these values accordingly as your public endpoint changes.
# See https://jss.sitecore.com/docs/fundamentals/services/view-engine
# If undefined, http://localhost:3000 is used by default.
# In production non-editing environments it is desirable to use relative URLs, so this may be set to empty string.

# To secure the Sitecore editor endpoint exposed by your Next.js app
# (`/api/editing/render` by default), a secret token is used. This (client-side)
# value must match your server-side value (see \sitecore\config\digitalsigns.config).
# We recommend an alphanumeric value of at least 16 characters.

# ====== Sitecore Preview / Delivery Edge ======

# Your Sitecore API key is needed to build the app. Typically, the API key is
# defined in `scjssconfig.json` (as `sitecore.apiKey`). This file may not exist
# when building locally (if you've never run `jss setup`), or when building in a
# higher environment (since `scjssconfig.json` is ignored from source control).
# In this case, use this environment variable to provide the value at build time.

# Your Sitecore API hostname is needed to build the app. Typically, the API host is
# defined in `scjssconfig.json` (as `sitecore.layoutServiceHost`). This file may
# not exist when building locally (if you've never run `jss setup`), or when building
# in a higher environment (since `scjssconfig.json` is ignored from source control).
# In this case, use this environment variable to provide the value at build time.

# Your GraphQL Edge endpoint. This is required for Sitecore Experience Edge.
